# Back 2 Basics with Arrays
A quick code kata around arrays, wrote in javascript, with some unit test support to ensure completion

# How
- `git clone <url>` down this work as normal, nice and simple.
- run `npm install` after pulling it down to grab all the node modules, this will be used for jest. 
- run `npm test` to fire up jest and run the tests, you'll see feedback in the console instantly.
- if you want to debug your solution using console.log, you can put them in line in the function and see them in the console by by running `npm run debugger`

# Don't
- Modify any of the tests
- Modify the list of people
- Modify the method names or signature (by adding parameters) within PeopleParser.

# Do
- Commit Frequently (there's 7 unrelated questions here.) 
- Your first goal is making the tests go green, by any method possible. You can refactor to an elegant solution after it's green.
- Feel free to share this with others.
- Have fun, if the tests are wrong or you can think of any other functions to add, let me know.

As on writing this i'm yet to actual have an answer sheet for this, I'll add this later on.
